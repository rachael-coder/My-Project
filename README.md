# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
In a world that is quickly evolving towards adapting the use of technology, businesses have followed suit in bringing their stores and marketing on the internet.


In this project I look at sales of various products in different regions.


# Questions that involve the Online Sales


1. What are the peak sales periods?

2. What marketing strategies can be used based on Payment Methods?

3. How is the region related to the total revenue?

# My findings


1. What are the peak sale seasons and what are the factors that may have led to the results

The peak seasons  appear to be between the first and the fourth months.

The most revenue was collected in the first four months.

Factors that may have led to the trend shown above in the line graph:

a) Seasonal Products.

If it's a business selling things like winter coats or holiday decorations, the peak in month 1 might be due to holiday shopping. The smaller peak in month 
3 could be a clearance sale or a smaller holiday.

b) Subscription Service.

If it's a subscription service, the initial peak might be from a big launch or promotion, and the decline could be people not renewing.

c) External Factors.

Things like economic downturns, competitor actions, or even the weather can impact sales.


2.  What marketing strategies can be found through analyzing the payment methods


The above values show that payment via credit card was the most used mode of payment.

Below are some marketing strategies:

a) Targeting Campaigns.

It is clear that Credit Cards are the most common payment method, marketing efforts can be tailored towards incentives that encourage users to make larger purchases or reward frequent Credit Card users (like, offering special discounts or cashback offers for Credit Card payments).

PayPal users might respond well to promotions emphasizing convenience or security, as PayPal is often associated with faster and safer transactions.

If Debit Cards are less popular, you could run specific campaigns aimed at encouraging debit card usage (like offering lower transaction fees or special discounts for debit card payments)

b) Behavioral Analysis

Tracking which payment method is used more often can give insights into customer behavior. For instance, if a lot of customers are using Credit Cards, it may indicate they are comfortable with higher spending or value points and rewards. PayPal may indicate an audience that values speed and security, while Debit Card users might be more budget-conscious.

Based on these insights, you could adjust your marketing tone—promoting value or convenience to match the preferences of each payment group.


3. How is the region related to the total revenue, how it affects online sales and how to use results found to improve the online sales?


North America is the strongest revenue generator overall, with both a higher median and higher potential for exceptionally high revenue (as shown by the outliers).

Europe demonstrates moderate and relatively consistent revenue performance.

Asia has the lowest revenue generation among the three regions, with less variability in the central data but still the possibility of higher outliers.

How does this affect online sales:

a) Customer Service.

i) Multilingual Support.

Provide multilingual customer support to cater to customers from different regions.   

ii) Local Customer Service Channels.

Consider offering customer support through channels popular in specific regions, such as local social media platforms or messaging apps.

b) Optimize Marketing Spend

i) Allocate Budget Based on Potential.

Allocate your online marketing budget based on the revenue potential of each region. North America, for instance, might warrant a larger share of the budget given its strong performance.

ii) Track Return On Investment(ROI)

Closely track the return on investment (ROI) of your online marketing campaigns in each region to ensure you're getting the most out of your spending.

How to improve online sales in the region:

i) Market Research.

Conduct thorough market research to understand the specific needs and preferences of online shoppers in a specific region. 
  
ii) Mobile Optimization.

Given the high mobile penetration in many Asian countries, prioritize mobile optimization of your website and check out process. 
  
iii) Payment Options.

Offer a variety of payment options popular in Asia, including mobile wallets and local payment gateways.
